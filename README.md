# PRODIGY_CS_01
This Python program implements a basic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. The user can input a message, select a shift value, and choose to either encrypt or decrypt the message. The result is displayed in the GUI. The script utilizes the `caesar_cipher` function to perform the encryption and decryption operations.
